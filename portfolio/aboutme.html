            <p>I have played soccer since I was 3 years old. I played club with LA Breakers, and then when I moved to the Bay Area, I joined Silicon Valley Soccer Academy. I also played four years on both of my high school's varsity teams. I love playing soccer, but sometimes it is hard to balance with how much school work I have. Lastly, I hope to play some form of soccer in college.</p>
